Sympathy Won't Help

As the death toll rose to seven in the Orly airport bombing, the French Government last week painfully weighed its longstanding sympathy for Armenian nationalism.
The bomb, hidden in a suitcase, devasted the Turkish Airlines counter and wounded 55 people.
Officials believed it was meant to explode inside an Istanbul-bound plane - in revenge for a wholesale Armenian massacre by the Turks early in the century and confiscation of Armenian lands in Turkey. France, which is home to 300,000 Armenians, has repeatedly chastised Turkey for not acknowledging their grievances.
But France has been tormented by terrorists for some time, and President Francois Mitterrand had pledged a crackdown. By week's end, police had raided strongholds of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, confiscating arms and capturing Varadjian Garbidjian, a Syrian of Armenian extraction who claimed to be the leader and bomber. Western diplomats have reported financial ties between the Syrian Government and the Secret Army.
The raids yielded 50 other Armenians believed to have links to the terrorist group, of whom 20 were being held without charge. French officials said as many as 11 would be expelled; some are Iranian citizens. Turkey requested extradition of those with Turkish passports. But the Second World Congress of Armenians, meeting in Switzerland, appealed to the French ''tradition of justice and freedom to insure that those Armenians are not handed over to their enemies'' and ''certain death.''
